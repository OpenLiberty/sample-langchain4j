description: Enable the MicroProfile Health feature in server.xml for Open Liberty deployment
tags: [microprofile, health, deployment, testing]

If you are deploying your application to Open Liberty, enable the MicroProfile Health feature in your `server.xml` configuration:

```xml
<featureManager>
    <feature>mpHealth-4.0</feature> <!-- match the Microprofile version you're targeting -->
</featureManager>
```

This setting allows Liberty to detect and register your health check classes and expose the `/health` endpoints.
